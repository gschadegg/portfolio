# Personal Portfolio Site

This is my personal site built with Gatsby.js and hosted on Gatsby Cloud to showcase any side projects, skill set, and a little bit about myself. Went with Gatsby for it's speed and SEO benefits, included Markdown for Project data files, and TailWindCSS to minimize how much supporting CSS I would have to generate.

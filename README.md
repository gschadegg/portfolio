# Personal Portfolio Site

This is my new personal site built with Gatsby.js and hosted on Gatsby Cloud. I wanted to create a portfolio website that would showcase my work, skill set, and a little bit about myself. Went with Gatsby for it's fast speed and improved SEO, Markdown for Project data files, and TailWindCSS to minimize how much supporting CSS I would have to generate.

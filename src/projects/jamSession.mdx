description: "Jam Session focus was on the creation of a web service where users can search for artists, tracks, or both simultaneously to create and share momentary playlists with friends, using Flask and Vite. When users click on returned artists, a new search for tracks by that artist is initiated, and tracks can be added to a locally stored session playlist."
